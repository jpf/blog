There are so many blogging solutions out there. Medium, dev.to, WordPress, Blogger, Jekyll, Github Gists, and more. Yet this site isn't using any of them. *But why? Why not just pick one and start writing?*

For a couple of years, those questions have been popping into my head every once in a while. I've tried [Medium](https://medium.com/@kimmobrunfeldt/introduction-to-sauce-labs-3ad082fc7dd5) for a few testing related posts, [Blogger](http://scouringmacbook.blogspot.com/2012/10/setting-everything.html) for macOS configuration posts, [WordPress](https://alvarcarto.com/) for a business website, [Github repo](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/howto-everything) with `.md` files, and many open-source solutions like Jekyll, Ghost, Hugo, and Hexo.

_Let's talk about the hosted platforms first._

The goal of this blog is to share my thoughts and ideally help other people. To achieve that, there's no need to track users, ask if they want to receive notifications via service workers, ask their location, their name, or anything like that. There's just the content in a minimal digital frame.

Talking about content — it should be accessible, searchable, open, and permanent. Not many hosted services share these ideologies.

_What about open source solutions?_

From here on, it starts to get a bit more blurry. The content I want to share is tightly related code and my vision is to make the posts interactive, visual, and understandable. I'm thinking:

> If I start a blog, the platform shouldn't come in the way of expressing ideas.

Self-hosted open-source blogging tools looked very polished and tempting, but somehow they didn't feel like the _"ultimate solution"_ that I'm looking for. I had a feeling that my motivation would slowly fade away while trying to customise them.

In addition to the subjective arguments and feelings, I gathered a list of other hard requirements and goals:

* Custom domain
* Permanent URLs for posts
* Technically flexible for possible needs in the future: *code highlighting*, *SVG animations*, *interactive charts*, and *any custom components* that help understanding concepts
* Content should be readable without JavaScript

So DIY it was. It felt like the most interesting and fun approach. Since the posts would have dynamic components and visualisations, I chose React and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). They were familiar tools.

If you've agreed with my decisions up until this point, great! However, the process of reinventing the wheel is definitely not over yet.

Lately, I've been obsessed with web performance. It's starting to get normal for a website to download 15 MB of uncompressed data to display simple information. That's too much! I wanted to make this site [as minimal in size as possible](/perf/) while considering the vision of interactive and dynamic content.

  <ChatMessage from="them">
    Alright, I kind of get it. Will you be using Gatsby or React Static then?
  </ChatMessage>
  <ChatMessage from="me">
    Well...
  </ChatMessage>
</ChatDiscussion>

After a bit of initial hesitation between do-it-yourself or `npm i gatsby`, I decided to `git init` and started coding a Gatsby-like static site generator. It sounded like a huge time sink but I wanted to know how minimal it can get. The benefits of a custom static site generator compared to Gatsby would be most probably microscopical, but why not? Reinventing a thing is always a good learning experience. It would also provide answers to a few questions I've been wondering.

> What benefits do Gatsby or React Static have?
> Could the page bundle be even smaller?
>
> How hard can it be to just renderToString and hydrate?

It wasn't a breeze, that's for sure, but I'm really happy with the result. The following post will contain more details about the actual solution.

I don't know if this path will lead to the _"ultimate solution"_. The blog could become yet another React-bloated static site — or something cool.
