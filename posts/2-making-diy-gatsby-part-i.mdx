The title is a bit ambitious. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a general purpose tool that has everything you need: *customisable data sources accessed via GraphQL*, *optimised build pipeline*, *functionality via plugins*, and so on. We on the other hand will make a build system that doesn't even have a live reload. The topic will be covered in a few separate blog posts.

Disclaimers out of the way, let's jump straight into building. The goal isn't to build a better Gatsby but to understand the complexity and possibly make the bundle footprint smaller. The high level idea is pretty straightforward: convert a bunch of source files and content to a static site in `output/` directory.

<Presentic alt="Build pipeline overview presentation" duration={1200} src="/content-assets/2/build-pipeline-overview.svg" />

We ["simply"](https://www.knowledgeowl.com/home/dont-say-simply-jim-fisher) need to implement the _Build pipeline_ box in the middle. One way to start figuring out a system is from the usage perspective.

Let's go through how the system should work. There's a file server that serves the contents of `output/` directory. When a user loads `/posts/` path in their browser, the server responds with contents of `output/posts/index.html` file. When the browser reads the response, it's favorable to have the actual page content in the HTML before the browser even parses JavaScript. This way, the content loads faster, is SEO friendly, and is accessible even when JS has been disabled.

That covers the read-only content, but for richer interaction we need to generate a JS bundle that kicks off the dynamism. Using the same example, we also need to have a `output/posts/hydrate.js` file that'll be run at page load.

In single page apps, the server is usually configured to send the same `index.html` for any requested path. JavaScript would then read `window.location` and decide which page content to render based on the frontend routing. But we don't want that. We want a static site that can be hosted in S3 or any simple file hosting.

Static sites on the other hand can have multiple possible entrypoints into the application. Each page needs to be able to independently bootstrap the JavaScript UI. This blog uses React, but the same principles apply to all frameworks.

This is how `output/posts/index.html` looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Posts - kimmo.blog</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="react-root">
      <!-- Content that is rendered on site generation -->
    </div>
    <script type="module" src="./hydrate.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The actual page content is rendered inside the `<div>` using [ReactDOM.renderToString()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertostring) at build phase. The `hydrate.js` is generated from the `hydrate-page-template.tsx` below.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import siteData from "site-data.json";
// Will be replaced with e.g. "src/components/pages/Posts"
import PageComponent from "{{{ pageImportPath }}}";

const reactRoot = "react-root";
// Will be replaced with e.g. "/posts/"
const pagePath = "{{{ pagePath }}}";
const page = siteData.pages.find((page) => page.data.path === pagePath);

window.addEventListener("load", () => {
  ReactDOM.hydrate(
    <PageComponent pageData={page.data} siteData={siteData} />,
    document.getElementById(reactRoot)
  );
});
```

*We'll come back to the templating later.* When `hydrate.js` loads up, it'll pass the correct data for `<PageComponent>` which is `<Posts>` in this case. The browser ends up rendering the same [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) structure that the server already sent, but this time React is listening for user input and re-renders when needed.

All pages have the same directory structure:

* `output/`
  * `index.html`
  * `hydrate.js`
  * `posts/`
    * `index.html`
    * `hydrate.js`
  * `another-page/`
    * `index.html`
    * `hydrate.js`

That's the rough idea. There's a ton of details that still need to be solved though. In the [next part](../3-making-diy-gatsby-part-ii/) we'll look into module bundling and Rollup.
