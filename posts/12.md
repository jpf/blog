Delegation by accident?

You might be familiar with the situations when your close ones ask help with their computers from you. You also often feel that they would do perfectly well by fixing it themselves too.

* This same happens in work context too. When someone takes the driver seat of a task, you'll let them drive and tone down your own thought work to focus on other things. It's a good thing if intended, but can also happen by accident.
* Another reason for asking can be a social one.
