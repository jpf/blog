This post is about implementing the ultimate Tailwind-React integration and typings for it.

In the process, we'll learn about most of the advanced TypeScript features including template literals and recursive types. The typings are demonstrated via React components, but the final solution works in any TypeScript project.



## Quick intro to Tailwind

Tailwind's website has an accurate pitch that describes its purpose well:

> A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

If you're sceptical about Tailwind in general, I suggest reading [CSS Utility Classes and "Separation of Concerns"](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/) by Adam Wathan.

Anyways, Tailwind produces plain CSS, everything is customisable via the config file, and its public API is the class names.


### Prerequisites

The first prerequisite is about string concatenation. Using Tailwind in dynamic components, such as in React, has [one vital rule](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production#writing-purgeable-html).

> It is important to avoid dynamically creating class strings in your templates with string concatenation, otherwise PurgeCSS won’t know to preserve those classes.

In other words, don't do this:

```tsx
<p className={`text-${color}`}>Hello!</p>
```

When doing string concatenation, Tailwind doesn't know which specific `text-` color classes to include in the CSS build. It uses a regex to find complete strings from the source code, to detect which Tailwind classes are actually used in the project. This process of minification is called purging. You can safelist special cases and even regex class name patterns, but it's tedious and can lead to large CSS output.

Purging is important, because there is a huge amount of possible combinations of class names. There's actually tens of thousands of them! Unpurged `output.css` from Tailwind can weigh even 8 megabytes.


It sounds scary, but in reality your application will use only a fraction of them. Maybe a few thousands at maximum, which totals to some 10kB.

The second prerequisite is that Tailwind class names have equal specificity.  You can't override previously written class names as you might intuitively expect:

```tsx
<button className="rounded p-4 flex p-0">Ok</button>
```

In the above example `p-0` does not override `p-4`. Whichever class is defined first in Tailwind's `output.css` wins. That's how CSS specificity works. Another example for a real use case:

```tsx
// Doesn't work
const baseCls = "rounded p-4 bg-primary hover:cursor-pointer"
const disabledCls = "bg-gray-200 hover:cursor-not-allowed"

const finalCls = `
  ${baseCls}
  ${props.disabled ? disabledCls : ''}
`;


// Do this instead
const baseCls = "rounded p-4"
const primaryCls = "bg-primary hover:cursor-pointer"
const disabledCls = "bg-gray-200 hover:cursor-not-allowed"

const finalCls = `
  ${baseCls}
  ${props.disabled
    ? disabledCls
    : primaryCls
   }
`;
```

Here's a [GitHub issue discussion](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/1010) about this commonly appearing topic.


Now that we know these limitations, the following decisions make more sense.


## The desired result

React components have changing props, but Tailwind doesn't like dynamically created class names. How do we solve the equation?

The problem could be framed: *What's the cleanest way to implement a function that transforms component props into Tailwind class names while adhering to the limitations?*

It sounds like a trivial task. However, implementing it in a clean and readable way with all the constraints in mind is another story.

There are multiple ways to dynamically format `className` strings, but to me [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) provides the perfect balance of readability and convenience. It's great as is, but there's nothing guarding you from typos or using Tailwind class names that were purged for some reason.

What we want is *classnames*, but with strict typings. Let's call this new more strict function `cn`.

```typescript
import classnames from 'classnames'

// TODO: Implement typings
const cn = (...args: Todo) => classnames(...args)
```

After implementing the types, we should be able to catch all the incorrect calls at type-level:

```typescript
const Hello = () => {
  // typo in regular string
  return <p className={cn(`text-blaxk-100 bg-white`)}>
    Hello!
  </p>
}

const Hello2 = ({ disabled }: Props) => {
  return <p className={cn([
    'flex my-5',
    // typo in a string in the array format
    `text-blaxk-100 bg-white`,
    disabled ? 'bg-gray-100 cursor-not-allowed'
  ])}>
    Hello!
  </p>
}

const Hello3 = ({ dense }: Props) => {
  return <p className={cn(`text-black-100 bg-white`, {
    // typo in object key format
    'px-asd2 py-1 my-2': dense,
    'px-3 py-2 my-3': !dense,
  })}>
    Hello!
  </p>
}

const Hello4 = ({ dense }: Props) => {
  return <p
    // long class name definition with a typo.
    // note the leading and trailing spaces
    // on each line
    className={cn(`
      flexxx
      text-black-100 bg-white
      hover:text-black-300
      hover:border-b-2
    `, {
      'px-1 py-3 my-4': dense
      'px-2 py-4 my-6': !dense,
    })}
  >
    Hello!
  </p>
}
```

To me, that's the holy grail. Let's start implementing!


## Implementation

The final typings serve as a neat real-life example that covers almost all advanced features in TypeScript. The individual pieces we need for the desired outcome are:

1. Type containing all valid Tailwind class names. For example `type ClassName = 'p-1' | 'p-2' | 'etc'`.
1. Type that trims leading and trailing whitespace of strings.
1. A way to split the whole `className` string into word tokens and validate them against `ClassName`.
1. Error message type that shows which is the offending token. For example `'flexxx' is not a valid Tailwind class`.
1. Support all of the above for string, object, and array types.

Let's cover them one by one, and tie it all together in the end.

### 1. Tailwind class names

There are multiple ways to generate a union type out of all class names. One solution would be to use the ability to expand template literal type unions:

```typescript
type ColorName = 'red' | 'purple' | 'blue' | 'green'
type Luminance = 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | 600 | 700 | 800 | 900
type Color = `${ColorName}-${Luminance}`
type Layout = 'block' | 'flex' | 'grid' | 'inline-block'

// Expands to all possible class names
type ClassName = Layout | `text-${Color}` | `bg-${Color}`
```

But it's a lot of work and the typings would need to be generated based on [tailwind.config.js](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration). In addition, it would lead to a huge union type with more than 60 000 unique string literals.

Instead of template literal expansion, using [postcss-ts-classnames](https://github.com/esamattis/postcss-ts-classnames) eliminates the issues. It parses the output of PostCSS, exctracts all class names, and writes the union type of them to a `d.ts` file.

The result is a robust typing, that doesn't care about Tailwind's configuration or purging. It accurately captures all the class names your project has.

A downside is that a small lag is introduced to development:

* A new valid Tailwind class name is taken into use
* For a short while, IDE complains about the class not being valid
* PostCSS build is ran, which re-generates the `d.ts` types
* IDE does a TypeScript refresh, and the error is gone

Now we have `tailwindClassNames.d.ts` which contains a union type of all valid class names:

```typescript
type ClassName =
  | 'block'
  | 'inline-block'
  | 'flex'
  | 'grid'
  | 'bg-gray-100'
  // ... a thousand more
```

### 2. Trimming whitespace

Let's start with leading whitespace. For the trick, we'll use [inference with template literals](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html#inference-with-template-literals).


```typescript
// Newlines occur in multiline strings with backtick quotes
type Whitespace = ' ' | '\n'

// `extends string` validates that the
// type argument `T` is a string
type TrimLeading<T extends string> =
  // Is `T` in format: ` ${Tail}` or `\n${Tail}`?
  T extends `${Whitespace}${infer Tail}`
    // Yes. Recursively call this utility again,
    // because Tail might contain new leading
    // whitespace.
    ? TrimLeading<Tail>
    // No. Stop recursion.
    : Tail
```

Note that in each iteration of the recursive loop, only one whitespace character is "eaten" from the result at a time. This happens because in the conditional, the type argument `T` needs to exactly match the template ```${Whitespace}${infer Tail}```. Since `Whitespace` can only be 1 character long, it consumes only one whitespace character at a time.

The type instantiation depth limit was [increased to 500](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/45025) in TypeScript, to support this exact use case better. It means that we can theoretically trim 500 leading whitespace characters at maximum. The amount decreases when the utility is a part of larger type chain, which is often the case.

However, there's an optimization trick. You can pre-define a few different lengths of whitespaces to minimize the amount of depth required:

```typescript
type InstantiationDepthReducingWhitespace =
  // This will match first, consuming 3 leading spaces at once
  | '   '
  | '  '
  | ' '
  | '\n'
```

Neat! Now let's do the same for trailing whitespace and combine both:

```typescript
type InstantiationDepthReducingWhitespace =
  | '   '
  | '  '
  | ' '
  | '\n'

type TrimLeading<T extends string> =
  T extends `${InstantiationDepthReducingWhitespace}${infer Tail}`
    ? TrimLeading<Tail>
    : Tail

type TrimTrailing<T extends string> =
  T extends `${infer Prefix}${InstantiationDepthReducingWhitespace}`
    ? TrimTrailing<Prefix>
    : Prefix

type Trim<T extends string> = TrimTrailing<TrimLeading<T>>
```

### 3. Split to tokens and validate




### 4. Error messages

The built-in way to indicate a type error is to use [never](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#the-never-type).
