If server-side rendering React is so complicated, **what are the benefits?**
For me, server-side rendering an app is more fluent tooling for the job. Traditionally, the main HTML content is rendered in the backend. Empty containers with a known `#id`s are added to the DOM to be later filled with content using JavaScript. There's many benefits in the traditional model, no doubt about it. One major drawback though is that the dynamic content isn't available at page load. It becomes an afterthought.

Pre-rendered React ties it nicely together: you get good performance, SEO, benefits of TypeScript everywhere, and rich dynamic frontend functionality. Backend returns a frozen snapshot of the app and frontend brings it back to life.
