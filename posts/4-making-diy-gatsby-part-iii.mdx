*This is the Part&nbsp;III of a series where we'll look into how kimmo.blog works. Part&nbsp;III covers how MDX rendering works.*

*Motivation has been covered in [Writing, or coding](../1-writing-or-coding/).*

## What is MDX

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is an amazing markup format. It allows familiar authoring experience with markdown syntax, but with the capability of adding custom React components along with the text.

For example this source

```markdown
**Here's** an _example_ of a [toast](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/11998/what-is-a-toast-notification):

<ButtonLink onClick={() => info('This is amazing!')}>Spawn a toast</ButtonLink>
```

would render:

**Here's** an _example_ of a [toast](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/11998/what-is-a-toast-notification):

<div className="mb-paragraph">
  <ButtonLink onClick={() => info('This is amazing!')}>Spawn a toast</ButtonLink>
</div>

All this could be achieved with just React components, but it's just not as smooth of a writing experience. Paragraphs would need to be wrapped in `<p>` elements, links would become cumbersome to type, and blah.

Writing blog posts as React components would make the build steps cushy, but we are already on the over-engineering train so let's continue.

## How MDX works

This blog uses [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote/) library to deal with MDX rendering. It's been designed for Next.js, but it also works well for our use case.

While MDX is an incredible authoring experience, it comes at the price of complexity when done right. By right, I mean with good performance. MDX text can be sent as a raw string to the browser and let it do the heavy lifting with [@mdx-js/runtime](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/runtime#mdx-jsruntime), but that's not recommended:

> "⚠️ warning: this is not the preferred way to use MDX since it introduces a substantial amount of overhead and dramatically increases bundle sizes. It must not be used with user input that isn’t sandboxed."

To speed things up in the browser, next-mdx-remote compiles the MDX to minified JavaScript server-side. In the blog context, server-side means in [src/generator/render.tsx](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/blog/blob/3f15ad33ed431486136b612a32a1b1339596b28b/src/generator/render.tsx#L193). The [serialize](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote/blob/3.0.4/src/serialize.ts#L57) method does this using [@mdx-js/mdx](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/blob/v2.0.0-next.9/docs/getting-started/index.mdx#do-it-yourself) and [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) under the hood. The compiled code is a React component that represents the MDX content.

This is how the previous example would be serialized:

```tsx
import { serialize } from "next-mdx-remote/serialize";

const content = `
**Here's** an _example_ of a [toast](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/11998/what-is-a-toast-notification):

<ButtonLink onClick={() => info('This is amazing!')}>Spawn a toast</ButtonLink>
`;

const { compiledSource } = await serialize(content);
```

The `compiledSource` is a string that contains the compiled JavaScript. Here's the code unminified and simplified:

```js
function MDXContent(n) {
  var e = n,
    {
      components: o
    } = e,
    t = m(e, ["components"]);
  return mdx(MDXLayout, c(a(a({}, layoutProps), t), {
    components: o,
    mdxType: "MDXLayout"
  }), mdx("p", null, mdx("strong", {
    parentName: "p"
  }, "Here's"), " an ", mdx("em", {
    parentName: "p"
  }, "example"), " of a ", mdx("a", a({
    parentName: "p"
  }, {
    href: "https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/11998/what-is-a-toast-notification"
  }), "a toast"), ":"), mdx(ButtonLink, {
    onClick: () => info("This is amazing!"),
    mdxType: "ButtonLink"
  }, "Spawn a toast"))
}
```

In the browser, [next-mdx-remote evals](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote/blob/3.0.4/src/index.tsx#L97) the code with [Reflect.construct()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect/construct), and renders the MDXContent:


```tsx
<MDX.MDXProvider components={components}>
  <MDXContent />
</MDX.MDXProvider>
```

## How the blog renders posts

The high-level flow of rendering `.mdx` pages is similar to React pages, but has more steps:

* Find all `.mdx` blog posts
* For each blog post:
    * Parse metadata from [front matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter)
    * Render [PostPage.tsx.template](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/blog/blob/main/src/templates/PostPage.tsx.template)
    * Render [pageHydrate.tsx.template](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/blog/blob/main/src/templates/pageHydrate.tsx.template)
    * Render [page.html.template](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/blog/blob/main/src/templates/page.html.template) with the HTML generated from MDX and other metadata
    * Save a `compiledSource.txt` file which contains the MDX content compiled to minified JavaScript.

We'll soon understand why `.txt` extension is used. Let's go through the templates one by one.

### PostPage.tsx.template

The [template](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/blog/blob/main/src/templates/PostPage.tsx.template) looks like this:

```tsx
import { PostLayout } from "src/components/PostLayout";
import { MDXRemote } from "src/components/MDXRemote";
// Will be replaced with "./compiledSource.txt"
import compiledSource from "{{{ compiledSourcePath }}}";

export default function PageComponent(props) {
  return (
    <PostLayout siteData={props.siteData} data={props.pageData}>
      <MDXRemote compiledSource={compiledSource} />
    </PostLayout>
  );
}
```

The purpose of the rendered file is to represent the React component for a blog post page. The template will be rendered to a verbosely named file: `output/posts/<slug>/<slug>-post.tsx`.

It's easier to debug the build process when unique names are used instead of tens of "post.tsx" files.

### pageHydrate.tsx.template

The same template that we used to render React pages in [Part II](../3-diy-gatsby-part-ii/). In React pages, the import refers to a page component in the source code.

```tsx
import PageComponent from "src/pages/NotFound404";
```

With MDX pages on the other hand, the `PageComponent` is imported from the dynamically rendered post page file:

```tsx
import PageComponent from "./1-writing-or-coding-post";
```

The template is saved to `output/posts/<slug>/<slug>-post-hydrate.tsx`.

### page.html.template

Again, the same template as for React pages. The MDX content will be rendered as HTML in `<body>`. Blog post title, description, and tags from the front matter are rendered into `<head>`:

```html
<title>Writing, or coding - kimmo.blog</title>
<meta name="description" content="Do I want to write content, or do I want to code a blog?" />
<meta name="keywords" content="meta,blog,content creation" />
```

### compiledSource.txt

As mentioned, this file contains the minified JavaScript that represents the MDX as a React component.

*Why does it have a `.txt` extension then?*

We need to be able to transfer the code exactly as-is to the browser, so that it can be passed as a string to [MDXRemote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#apis). A good way to do this is using a [rollup string plugin](https://github.com/TrySound/rollup-plugin-string). The plugin has been [configured](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/blog/blob/3f15ad33ed431486136b612a32a1b1339596b28b/rollup.config.js#L28) so that a TypeScript code can import any `.txt` file, and the exact contents will be assigned to a variable.

This functionality used to be just a simple text replacement directly into code, but that broke with special characters and line breaks.


## To recap

<Presentic alt="MDX rendering" duration={1200} src="/content-assets/4/dir-structure-build-mdx.svg" />

Each `.mdx` blog post file ends up creating quite some files in the output directory. First TypeScript files and `compileSource.txt` are rendered, then Rollup transpiles the source code into JS bundles, and finally static assets are copied.
