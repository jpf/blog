This post is about making the ultimate Tailwind-React integration and typings for it. In the process, we'll learn about advanced TypeScript features including template literals and recursive types.

Sounds cool, but what's Tailwind? Their website describes the following:

> A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

It's an accurate pitch. Tailwind produces plain CSS and doesn't require any specific JavaScript framework. We'll be focusing on using Tailwind in a TypeScript React project, but the typings work with any frontend framework.


## Prerequisite 1

Before presenting the desired typing solution, let's cover one crucial detail. Using Tailwind in dynamic components, such as in React, has [a vital rule](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production#writing-purgeable-html).

> It is important to avoid dynamically creating class strings in your templates with string concatenation, otherwise PurgeCSS wonâ€™t know to preserve those classes.

In other words, don't do this:

```tsx
<p className={`text-${color}`}>Hello!</p>
```

When doing string concatenation, Tailwind doesn't know which specific `text-` color classes to include in the CSS build. It uses a regex to find complete strings from the source code, to detect which Tailwind classes are actually used in the project. This process of minification is called purging. You can safelist special cases and even regex class name patterns, but it's tedious and can lead to large CSS output.

Purging is important, because there is a huge amount of possible combinations of class names. There's actually tens of thousands of them! Unpurged `output.css` from Tailwind can weigh even 8 megabytes.


It sounds scary, but in reality your application will use only a fraction of them. Maybe a few thousands at maximum, which totals to some 10kB.

Now that we know this limitation, the following decisions make more sense.

## Prerequisite 2

Classnames can't override each other.

## The desired result

It sounds like a trivial task to format Tailwind class names based on component props. However, implementing it in a clean and readable way, while keeping the previous limitations in mind is another story.

The problem we are solving in its shortest form is: *What's the cleanest way to implement a function that transforms component props into class names?* In other words, we should implement a function with signature `(props: Props) => string`.

There are multiple ways to achieve the goal, but to me the perfect balance is using a solution like [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames). It's great as is, but there's nothing guarding you from typos or using class names that were purged for some reason.

The solution is to implement strict typings on top of *classnames*. Let's call the new function `cn`. A wrapper for *classnames*, but with strict types.

```typescript
import classnames from 'classnames'

// TODO: Implement typings
const cn = (...args: Todo) => classnames(...args)
```

After implementing the types, we should be able to catch all the incorrect calls:

```typescript
const Hello = () => {
  // typo in regular string
  return <p className={cn(`text-blaxk-100 bg-white`)}>
    Hello!
  </p>
}

const Hello2 = ({ dense }: Props) => {
  return <p className={cn(`text-black-100 bg-white`, {
    // typo in object key format
    'px-asd2 py-1 my-2': dense,
    'px-3 py-2 my-3': !dense,
  })}>
    Hello!
  </p>
}

const Hello2 = ({ dense }: Props) => {
  return <p
    // long class name definition, with a typo
    // note the leading and trailing spaces
    // on each line
    className={cn(`
      flexxx
      text-black-100 bg-white
      hover:text-black-300
      hover:border-b-2
    `, {
      'px-1 py-3 my-4': dense
      'px-2 py-4 my-6': !dense,
    })}
  >
    Hello!
  </p>
}
```
