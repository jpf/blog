It's amazing how Webpack is able to bundle practically any dependency you might install from NPM. The dependency might expose its code with CommonJS, UMD, global export, ES6 modules, or any of the module exporting standards the community has come up with. Webpack 4 just chews it up, even if it means a large bundle size. SIDENOTE: Fortunately Webpack 5 [will make users more aware](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/#automatic-nodejs-polyfills-removed).
