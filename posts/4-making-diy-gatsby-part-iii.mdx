*This is Part&nbsp;III of a series where we'll look into how kimmo.blog works. Part&nbsp;III covers MDX rendering.*

*Motivation has been covered in [Writing, or coding](../1-writing-or-coding/).*

## What is MDX

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is an amazing markup format. It allows familiar authoring experience using markdown syntax – with the capability of adding custom React components along with the text.

For example this source

```markdown
**Here's** an _example_ of a [toast](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/11998/what-is-a-toast-notification):

<ButtonLink onClick={() => info('This is amazing!')}>Spawn a toast</ButtonLink>
```

would render:

**Here's** an _example_ of a [toast](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/11998/what-is-a-toast-notification):

<div className="mb-paragraph">
  <ButtonLink onClick={() => info('This is amazing!')}>Spawn a toast</ButtonLink>
</div>

All this could be achieved with good old React components, but it's just not as smooth of a writing experience. Paragraphs would need to be wrapped in `<p>` elements, links would become cumbersome to type, and *blah*.

Writing blog posts in React would make the site generator simpler, but we're already on the over-engineering train so let's continue.

## How MDX works

While MDX is an incredible authoring experience, it comes at the price of complexity when done right. By right, I mean with good performance.

It is possible to greatly simplify the rendering, if performance is not a concern. MDX text could be sent as a raw string to the browser and it would do the heavy rendering with e.g. [@mdx-js/runtime](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/runtime#mdx-jsruntime). It would make the build pipeline simpler, but other aspects worse:

> "warning: this is not the preferred way to use MDX since it introduces a substantial amount of overhead and dramatically increases bundle sizes. It must not be used with user input that isn’t sandboxed."

This blog uses [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote/) library to deal with MDX rendering. It's been designed for Next.js, but it also works well for our use case.

To speed things up in the browser, next-mdx-remote compiles the MDX to minified JavaScript server-side. The [serialize](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote/blob/3.0.4/src/serialize.ts#L57) method does this using [@mdx-js/mdx](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/blob/v2.0.0-next.9/docs/getting-started/index.mdx#do-it-yourself) and [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) under the hood.

This is how the previous example would be serialized:

```tsx
import { serialize } from "next-mdx-remote/serialize";

const content = `
**Here's** an _example_ of a [toast](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/11998/what-is-a-toast-notification):

<ButtonLink onClick={() => info('This is amazing!')}>Spawn a toast</ButtonLink>
`;

const { compiledSource } = await serialize(content);
```

The `compiledSource` is a string that contains the compiled JavaScript. Here's the code unminified and simplified:

```js
function MDXContent(n) {
  var e = n,
    {
      components: o
    } = e,
    t = m(e, ["components"]);
  return mdx(MDXLayout, c(a(a({}, layoutProps), t), {
    components: o,
    mdxType: "MDXLayout"
  }), mdx("p", null, mdx("strong", {
    parentName: "p"
  }, "Here's"), " an ", mdx("em", {
    parentName: "p"
  }, "example"), " of a ", mdx("a", a({
    parentName: "p"
  }, {
    href: "https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/11998/what-is-a-toast-notification"
  }), "a toast"), ":"), mdx(ButtonLink, {
    onClick: () => info("This is amazing!"),
    mdxType: "ButtonLink"
  }, "Spawn a toast"))
}
```

In the browser, next-mdx-remote [evals](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote/blob/3.0.4/src/index.tsx#L97) the code with [Reflect.construct()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect/construct), and renders the MDXContent:


```tsx
<MDX.MDXProvider components={components}>
  <MDXContent />
</MDX.MDXProvider>
```

## How the blog renders posts

The high-level flow of rendering `.mdx` pages is similar to React pages, but has more steps:

* Find all `.mdx` blog posts
* For each blog post:
    * Parse metadata from [front matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter)
    * Render [PostPage.tsx.template](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/blog/blob/main/src/templates/PostPage.tsx.template)
    * Render [pageHydrate.tsx.template](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/blog/blob/main/src/templates/pageHydrate.tsx.template)
    * Render [page.html.template](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/blog/blob/main/src/templates/page.html.template) with the HTML generated from MDX and other metadata
    * Save a `compiledSource.txt` file which contains the MDX content as minified JavaScript.

We'll soon understand why `.txt` extension is used. Let's go through the templates one by one.

### PostPage.tsx.template

The [template](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/blog/blob/main/src/templates/PostPage.tsx.template) looks like this:

```tsx
import { PostLayout } from "src/components/PostLayout";
import { MDXRemote } from "src/components/MDXRemote";
// Will be replaced with "./compiledSource.txt"
import compiledSource from "{{{ compiledSourcePath }}}";

export default function PageComponent(props) {
  return (
    <PostLayout siteData={props.siteData} data={props.pageData}>
      <MDXRemote compiledSource={compiledSource} />
    </PostLayout>
  );
}
```

The purpose of the rendered file is to represent the React component for a blog post page. The template will be rendered to a verbosely named file: `output/posts/<slug>/<slug>-post.tsx`.

It's easier to debug the build process when unique names are used instead of tens of "post.tsx" files.

### pageHydrate.tsx.template

The same template that we used to render React pages in [Part II](../3-diy-gatsby-part-ii/). In React pages, the import refers to a page component in the source code.

```tsx
import PageComponent from "src/pages/NotFound404";
```

With MDX pages on the other hand, the `PageComponent` is imported from the dynamically rendered post page file:

```tsx
import PageComponent from "./1-writing-or-coding-post";
```

The template is saved to `output/posts/<slug>/<slug>-post-hydrate.tsx`.

### page.html.template

Again, the same template as for React pages. The MDX content will be rendered as HTML in `<body>`. Blog post title, description, and tags from the front matter are rendered into `<head>`:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Writing, or coding - kimmo.blog</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Do I want to write content, or do I want to code a blog?" />
    <meta name="keywords" content="meta,blog,content creation" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="react-root"><!-- MDX blog page as HTML --></div>
    <script type="module" src="./1-writing-or-coding-post-hydrate.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### compiledSource.txt

As mentioned, this file contains the MDX as minified JavaScript.

*Why does it have a `.txt` extension then?*

We need to be able to transfer the code exactly as-is to the browser, so that it can be passed as a string to [MDXRemote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#apis). A good way to do this is using a [rollup string plugin](https://github.com/TrySound/rollup-plugin-string). The plugin has been [configured](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/blog/blob/3f15ad33ed431486136b612a32a1b1339596b28b/rollup.config.js#L28) so that a TypeScript code can import any `.txt` file, and the exact contents will be assigned to a variable.

This functionality used to be just a simple text replacement directly into code, but that broke with special characters and line breaks.


## To recap

<Presentic alt="MDX rendering" duration={1200} src="/content-assets/4/dir-structure-build-mdx.svg" />

Each `.mdx` blog post file ends up creating quite some files in the output directory. First TypeScript files and `compileSource.txt` are rendered, then Rollup transpiles the source code into JS bundles, and finally static assets are copied.
