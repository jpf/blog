*This is the first part of a series of posts.*

We have to cover the disclaimers first. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a production-ready tool that has everything you need: *customisable data sources accessed via GraphQL*, *optimised build pipeline*, *functionality via plugins*, and so on. The build system that we'll go through on the other hand is experimental and doesn't even have frontend routing.

That out of the way, let's jump straight into building. The post will cover SSR basics, but even the seasoned developers should find some new interesting details.

The goal isn't to build a better Gatsby but to understand how it works and possibly make the bundle footprint even smaller. The high level idea is pretty straightforward: convert a bunch of source files and content to a static site in `output/` directory.

We ["simply"](https://www.knowledgeowl.com/home/dont-say-simply-jim-fisher) need to implement the _Build pipeline_ box in the middle. One way to start figuring out a system is from the usage perspective. Let's imagine there's a file server that serves everything under `output/` directory.

<Image maxWidth={550} alt="Figure of GET request" src="/content-assets/2/get-request.svg" />

When a user loads `/posts/` path in their browser, the server responds with contents of `output/posts/index.html` file. We want the page content to already be in the HTML at that stage. It will make the content load faster, more SEO friendly, and accessible even when JS has been disabled.

That covers the read-only content, but for richer interaction we need to generate a JS bundle that kicks off the dynamism. The traditional way would be to render HTML directly from e.g. Markdown, and JS would refer to the existing DOM elements via query selectors:

```javascript
const elements = document.querySelectorAll('.dynamic-element');
startDynamicStuff(elements);
```

That works, but it's not as convenient. It's missing some of the ergonomics I find pleasant in modern web development. Anyways, that's besides the point of this post. Let's get back to building the React based static site generation.

<Image maxWidth={550} alt="Figure of another GET request" src="/content-assets/2/get-request-hydrate.svg" />

Building on top of the example above, this time the returned HTML refers to a `hydrate.js` script that it'll execute in browser.


*TODO below here*

In single page apps, the server is usually configured to send the same `index.html` for any requested path. JavaScript would then read `window.location` and decide which page content to render based on the frontend routing. But we don't want that. We want a static site that can be hosted in S3 or any simple file hosting.

Static sites on the other hand can have multiple possible entrypoints into the application. Each page needs to be able to independently bootstrap the JavaScript UI. This blog uses React, but the same principles apply to all frameworks.

This is how `output/posts/index.html` looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Posts - kimmo.blog</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="react-root">
      <!-- Content that is rendered on site generation -->
    </div>
    <script type="module" src="./hydrate.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The actual page content is rendered inside the `<div>` using [ReactDOM.renderToString()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertostring) at build phase. The `hydrate.js` is generated from the `hydrate-page-template.tsx` below.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import siteData from "site-data.json";
// Will be replaced with e.g. "src/components/pages/Posts"
import PageComponent from "{{{ pageImportPath }}}";

const reactRoot = "react-root";
// Will be replaced with e.g. "/posts/"
const pagePath = "{{{ pagePath }}}";
const page = siteData.pages.find((page) => page.data.path === pagePath);

window.addEventListener("load", () => {
  ReactDOM.hydrate(
    <PageComponent pageData={page.data} siteData={siteData} />,
    document.getElementById(reactRoot)
  );
});
```

*We'll come back to the templating later.* When `hydrate.js` loads up, it'll pass the correct data for `<PageComponent>` which is `<Posts>` in this case. The browser ends up rendering the same [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) structure that the server already sent, but this time React is listening for user input and re-renders when needed.

All pages have the same directory structure:

* `output/`
  * `index.html`
  * `hydrate.js`
  * `posts/`
    * `index.html`
    * `hydrate.js`
  * `another-page/`
    * `index.html`
    * `hydrate.js`

That's the rough idea. There's a ton of details that still need to be solved though. In the [next part](../3-making-diy-gatsby-part-ii/) we'll look into module bundling and Rollup.
