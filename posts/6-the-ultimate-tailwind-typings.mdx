This post is about making the ultimate TypeScript typings for Tailwind class names. In the process, we'll dive deep into advanced TypeScript features.

First, what is Tailwind? Their website describes the following:

> A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

It's an accurate pitch. Tailwind produces plain CSS and doesn't require any specific JavaScript framework. We'll be focusing on using Tailwind in a TypeScript React project, but the typings work with any frontend framework.


## Prerequisite

Before presenting the desired typing solution, let's cover one important detail. Using Tailwind in dynamic components, such as in React, has [one important rule](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production#writing-purgeable-html).

> It is important to avoid dynamically creating class strings in your templates with string concatenation, otherwise PurgeCSS wonâ€™t know to preserve those classes.

In other words, don't do this:

```tsx
<p className={`text-${color}`}>Hello!</p>
```

Tailwind doesn't know which specific `text-` color classes to include in the CSS build. It uses a regex to find complete strings from the source code, to detect which Tailwind classes are actually used in the project. This process of minification is called purging. You can safelist special cases and even regex class name patterns, but it's tedious and can lead to large CSS output.

Purging is important, because there is a huge amount of possible combinations of class names. There's actually tens of thousands of them! Unpurged `output.css` from Tailwind can weigh 8 megabytes.

In reality, the

## Conditional types




## Flatten array or object types into a union

By using [Indexed Access Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/indexed-access-types.html), we can flatten array item types into a union type.

```typescript
// const array: (string | number | string[])[]
const array = [1, 'test', ['array']]

// type Item = string | number | string[]
type Item = typeof array[number]
```

Pretty neat! By accessing the array's type with `number`, we access
all possible indexes from the array type which results into union of its item types.

The same can be done for object's values, by using `keyof Obj`.

```typescript
// const obj: { num: number; str: string; arr: string[]; }
const obj = {
  num: 1,
  str: 'test',
  arr: ['array']
}

// type Item = string | number | string[]
type Item = typeof obj[keyof typeof obj]
```

## Iterate object's key-value types

As an example, let's convert object's value types to nullable. To do this, we'll use [Mapped types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html).

```typescript
// const obj: { num: number; str: string; arr: string[]; }
const obj = {
  num: 1,
  str: 'test',
  arr: ['array']
}

// Alias for convenience
// type Obj = { num: number; str: string; arr: string[]; }
type Obj = typeof obj

// type NullableObj = {
//   num: number | null
//   str: string | null
//   arr: string[] | null
// }
type NullableObj = {
  // Declarative way to iterate over each key in Object
  [Key in keyof Obj]: Obj[Key] | null
}


```

Using `Key in keyof Obj` as the key, tells typescript that you want to deal with each key separately. `Key` will become a temporary type variable, that can be used to index `Obj` or any other type.


## Use generics to make type functions

Generics can be thought as type functions. They get inputs as type arguments, and their return values are types. These functions call other type functions and even themselves to implement recursion.

Let's create a generic `MakeNullable` utility type that converts an object type `T` into a version where each value type can be nullable.

```typescript
// const obj: { num: number; str: string; arr: string[]; }
const obj = {
  num: 1,
  str: 'test',
  arr: ['array']
}

type MakeNullable<T> = {
  [Key in keyof T]: T[Key] | null
}

type NullableObj = MakeNullable<typeof obj>
```

## Convert deep structures with recursive generics

To 1-up the previous example, let's make a generic type `MakeNullableDeep` that deeply converts all object value types to nullable.

```typescript
// const obj: { num: number; str: string; arr: string[]; }
const obj = {
  num: 1,
  str: 'test',
  arr: ['array']
}

// Use alias for convenience
// type Obj = { num: number; str: string; arr: string[]; }
type Obj = typeof obj

// The generic type takes one type argument `T`, which will
// be converted to a version where each value can be nullable
type MakeNullableObj<T> = {
  [Key in keyof T]: T[Key] | null
}
```

## Write complex types from scratch

TypeScript supports conditionals, looping with recursion, and all kinds of advanced features, but with very limited syntax. Regular programming provides tools to make the code readable, but TypeScript offers quite little.

To understand a complex generic type, it's often easiest to write it from scratch. I've spent a ton of time trying to decode what different generic types mean, without great results. Often the shortest route to understanding has been a rewrite.

Writing the type again piece by piece might reveal that it wasn't that complex after all. Complexity is often a cause of the limited syntax.


## Don't use T for everything

Generics often use very cryptic type argument names. I'm not sure where the trend originates from, but it's not great for readability. I think the same naming rules apply as for regular code. Be descriptive. Instead of just `T`, you can name the type argument more explicitly, for example `Request` or `RequestT`.
