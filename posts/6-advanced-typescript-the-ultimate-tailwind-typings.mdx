This post is about implementing utilities for the ultimate Tailwind-React ergonomics and typings for it.

In the process, we'll learn about most of the advanced TypeScript features including complex conditionals, template literals, and recursive types. The typings are demonstrated via React components, but the final solution would work in any TypeScript project.

To get an idea what we're building, you can check out the final monstrous typings in a Replit project:

* [Typings and classnames utility](https://replit.com/@KimmoBrunfeldt/the-ultimate-tailwind-typings#src/tailwindUtils.ts)
* [Example usage in components](https://replit.com/@KimmoBrunfeldt/the-ultimate-tailwind-typings#src/Examples.tsx)


*You need to fork the repl if you want to enable TypeScript IntelliSense. Note that the typing hints appear slower in the online environment compared to a local setup.*

## Quick intro to Tailwind

Tailwind's website has an accurate pitch that describes its purpose well:

> A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

If you're sceptical about Tailwind in general, I suggest reading [CSS Utility Classes and "Separation of Concerns"](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/) by Adam Wathan. Anyways, Tailwind produces plain CSS, everything is customisable via the config file, and its public API is the class names.


### Constraints

There are a few constraints that greatly affect the shape of our solution. The first constraint is about string concatenation. Using Tailwind in dynamic components, such as in React, has [one vital rule](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production#writing-purgeable-html).

> It is important to avoid dynamically creating class strings in your templates with string concatenation, otherwise PurgeCSS won’t know to preserve those classes.

In other words, don't do this:

```tsx
<p className={`text-${color}`}>Hello!</p>
```

When doing string concatenation, Tailwind doesn't know which specific `text-` color classes to include in the CSS build. It uses a regex to find complete strings from the source code to detect which Tailwind classes are actually used in the project. Using the information, Tailwind can purge unnecessary CSS. There are ways to fine-tune the process, for example by specifying a list of regex class name patterns that should not be purged.

Purging is important, because there are a huge amount of possible class names. It might be a bit surprising, but there are actually tens of thousands of class names in Tailwind by default. Unpurged `output.css` from Tailwind can weigh even 8MB _(unminified, uncompressed)_.


It sounds scary, but in reality your application will use only a fraction of them. Maybe a few thousands at maximum, which totals to some 10kB.

![Tailwind class names Venn diagram](/content-assets/6/tailwind-classes-venn.svg)


The second prerequisite is that Tailwind class names have equal specificity.  You can't override previously written class names as you might intuitively expect:

```tsx
<button className="rounded p-4 flex p-0">Ok</button>
```

In the above example `p-0` does not override `p-4`. Whichever class is defined first in Tailwind's `output.css` wins. That's how CSS specificity works. Another example for a real use case:

```tsx
// Doesn't work. Background color and hover effect
// can't be changed by adding new classes in the end.
const baseCls = "rounded p-4 bg-primary hover:cursor-pointer"
const disabledCls = "bg-gray-200 hover:cursor-not-allowed"

const finalCls = `
  ${baseCls}
  ${props.disabled ? disabledCls : ''}
`;


// Do this instead.
const baseCls = "rounded p-4"
const primaryCls = "bg-primary hover:cursor-pointer"
const disabledCls = "bg-gray-200 hover:cursor-not-allowed"

const finalCls = `
  ${baseCls}
  ${props.disabled
    ? disabledCls
    : primaryCls
   }
`;
```

Here's a [GitHub issue discussion](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/1010) about this commonly appearing topic.


Now that we know these limitations, the following decisions make more sense.


## The desired result

React components have changing props, but Tailwind doesn't like dynamically created class names. The problem could be framed: *What's the cleanest way to implement a function that transforms component props into Tailwind class names while adhering to the limitations?*

It sounds like a trivial task. However, implementing it in a clean and readable way with all the constraints in mind is another story.

There are multiple ways to dynamically format `className` strings, but to me [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) provides the perfect balance of readability and convenience. It's great as is, but there's nothing guarding you from typos or using Tailwind class names that were purged for some reason.

What we want is *classnames*, but with strict typings. Let's call this new more strict function `cn`.

```typescript
import classnames from 'classnames'

// TODO: Implement typings
const cn = (...args: Todo) => classnames(...args)
```

After implementing the types, we should be able to catch all the incorrect calls at type-level:

```typescript
const Hello = () => {
  // typo in regular string
  return <p className={cn(`text-blaxk-100 bg-white`)}>
    Hello!
  </p>
}

const Hello2 = ({ disabled }: Props) => {
  return <p className={cn([
    'flex my-5',
    // typo in a string in the array format
    `text-blaxk-100 bg-white`,
    disabled ? 'bg-gray-100 cursor-not-allowed'
  ])}>
    Hello!
  </p>
}

const Hello3 = ({ dense }: Props) => {
  return <p className={cn(`text-black-100 bg-white`, {
    // typo in object key format
    'px-asd2 py-1 my-2': dense,
    'px-3 py-2 my-3': !dense,
  })}>
    Hello!
  </p>
}

const Hello4 = ({ dense }: Props) => {
  return <p
    // long class name definition with a typo.
    // note the leading and trailing spaces
    // on each line
    className={cn(`
      flexxx
      text-black-100 bg-white
      hover:text-black-300
      hover:border-b-2
    `, {
      'px-1 py-3 my-4': dense
      'px-2 py-4 my-6': !dense,
    })}
  >
    Hello!
  </p>
}
```

To me, that's the holy grail. Let's start implementing!


## Implementation

The final typings serve as a neat real-life example that covers almost all advanced features in TypeScript. The individual pieces we need for the desired outcome are:

1. Type containing all valid Tailwind class names. For example `type ClassName = 'p-1' | 'p-2' | 'etc'`.
1. Type that trims leading and trailing whitespace of strings.
1. Error message type that shows which is the offending token. For example `'flexxx' is not a valid Tailwind class`.
1. A way to split the whole `className` string into word tokens and validate them against `ClassName`.
1. Support for a string
1. Support for the object format
1. Support for the array format

Let's cover them one by one, and tie it all together in the end.

### 1. Tailwind class names

There's a few different routes for generating a union type out of all class names. One solution would be to use the ability to expand template literal type unions:

```typescript
type ColorName = 'red' | 'purple' | 'blue' | 'green'
type Luminance = 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | 600 | 700 | 800 | 900
type Color = `${ColorName}-${Luminance}`
type Layout = 'block' | 'flex' | 'grid' | 'inline-block'

// Expands to all possible class names
type ClassName = Layout | `text-${Color}` | `bg-${Color}`
```

But it's a lot of work and the typings would need to be generated based on [tailwind.config.js](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration). In addition, it would lead to a huge union type with more than 60 000 unique string literals.

Instead of template literal expansion, using [postcss-ts-classnames](https://github.com/esamattis/postcss-ts-classnames) eliminates the issues. It parses the output of PostCSS, exctracts all class names, and writes the union type of them to a `d.ts` file.

The result is a robust typing, that doesn't care about Tailwind's configuration or purging. It accurately captures all the class names your project has.

A downside is that a small lag is introduced to development:

* A new valid Tailwind class name is taken into use
* For a short while, IDE complains about the class not being valid
* PostCSS build is ran, which re-generates the `d.ts` types
* IDE does a TypeScript refresh, and the error is gone

Now we have `tailwindClassNames.d.ts` which contains a union type of all valid class names:

```typescript
type ClassName =
  | 'block'
  | 'inline-block'
  | 'flex'
  | 'grid'
  | 'bg-gray-100'
  // ... a thousand more
```

### 2. Trimming whitespace

Let's start with the leading whitespace. For this trick, we'll use [inference with template literals](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html#inference-with-template-literals).


```typescript
// Newlines occur in multiline strings with backtick quotes
type Whitespace = ' ' | '\n'

// `extends string` validates that the
// type argument `T` is a string
type TrimStart<T extends string> =
  // Is `T` in format: ` ${Tail}` or `\n${Tail}`?
  T extends `${Whitespace}${infer Tail}`
    // Yes. Recursively call this utility again,
    // because Tail might contain new leading
    // whitespace.
    ? TrimStart<Tail>
    // No. Stop recursion.
    : T
```

Note that in each iteration of the recursive loop, only one whitespace character is "eaten" from the result at a time. This happens because in the conditional, the type argument `T` needs to exactly match the template `` `${Whitespace}${infer Tail}` ``. Since `Whitespace` can only be 1 character long, it consumes only one whitespace character at a time.

The type instantiation depth limit was [increased to 500](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/45025) in TypeScript, to support this exact use case better. It was later [reduced back to a 100](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/45711), which isn't much for template literal processing.

However, there's an optimization trick. You can pre-define a few different lengths of whitespaces to minimize the amount of depth required:

```typescript
type InstantiationDepthReducingWhitespace =
  // This will match first, consuming 3 leading spaces at once
  | '   '
  | '  '
  | ' '
  | '\n'
```

Neat! Now let's do the same for trailing whitespace and combine both:

```typescript
type InstantiationDepthReducingWhitespace =
  | '   '
  | '  '
  | ' '
  | '\n'

type TrimStart<T extends string> =
  T extends `${InstantiationDepthReducingWhitespace}${infer Tail}`
    ? TrimStart<Tail>
    : T

type TrimEnd<T extends string> =
  T extends `${infer Prefix}${InstantiationDepthReducingWhitespace}`
    ? TrimEnd<Prefix>
    : T

type Trim<T extends string> = TrimEnd<TrimStart<T>>
```

The end result:

```typescript
// type Result = "abc"
type Result = Trim<'\n\n  abc   '>

// The need for trimming long whitespace appears
// in deeply nested (more indentation) multi-line strings:
function doSomething() {
  if (condition) {
    if (another) {
      cn(`
        block
        p-1
        hover:bg-blue
      `)
    }
  }
}
```

The same [pull request](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/45711),which lowered the type instantiation depth limit to 100, also implemented tail recursive evaluation of conditional types. Using the tricks explained in the description the `Trim` utility could be even further improved.

### 3. Error messages

The built-in way to indicate a type error is to use [never](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#the-never-type). It works because `never` is not assignable to any other type.

In complex conditional types you might have multiple instances of `never` type, but for separate issues. This makes the code hard to read and type errors less descriptive. Unfortunately, TypeScript [doesn't natively support](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/23689) anything like `throw`.

However, there is a hack that achieves almost the same result. Instead of returning `never`, you can return the error message as a literal string:

```typescript
type IsValid<T extends string> =
  T extends ClassName
    ? T
    : `Error: '${T}' is not a valid Tailwind class`
```

The literal string error message works in a similar way as `never`. Types aren't assignable to it in practice. It's easiest to understand via an example:

```typescript
function cn<T>(singleClassName: IsValid<T>) {
  return singleClassName;
}

// Argument of type '"invalid"' is not assignable to parameter of type
// '"Error: 'invalid' is not a valid Tailwind class"'.
cn('invalid')
```

The passed parameter typed as literal `'invalid'` is not assignable to the error message that's also a literal string type. This pattern can be extracted as a utility type to make the intention more clear:

```typescript
// Utility type to provide nicer error messages
type Err<Message extends string> = `Error: ${Message}`
```


### 4. Split to tokens and validate

This is going to be a tough piece.

To ease the token processing, let's make a utility that converts `className` string into an array of tokens. Working with an array is easier than for example a string with space separated values.

The new utility called `SplitToTailwindClassNames` should do the following conversions:

Input | Output
------|-------
`"block bg-gray-100"` | `["block", "bg-gray-100"]`
`"\n\n block\n  p-1  "` | `["block", "p-1"]`
`" block invalid "` | `["block", never]`


We'll start with the familiar template literal inference. This time instead of consuming whitespace characters, we want to consume Tailwind class names.

```typescript
type SplitToTailwindClassNames<T extends string> =
  // Does `T` start with a Tailwind class name?
  T extends `${ClassName}${infer Tail}`
    // Yes. Continue consuming ClassName tokens with
    // next recursion iteration.
    ? [ClassName, ...SplitToTailwindClassNames<Tail>]
    // No. Stop recursion.
    : []
```

We can see that the utility now knows how to consume Tailwind class name tokens.

```typescript
// type Debug1 = []
type Debug1 = SplitToTailwindClassNames<' '>

// type Debug2 = [ClassName]
type Debug2 = SplitToTailwindClassNames<'block'>

// type Debug3 = [ClassName, ClassName]
type Debug3 = SplitToTailwindClassNames<'blockp-1'>

// Note: whitespace is not correctly handled yet!

// type Debug4 = [ClassName]
type Debug4 = SplitToTailwindClassNames<'block p-1'>
```

That's great but the array items are of type `ClassName`, which is the union type itself. What we really need is the actual tokens found, for example `['block', 'p-1']`.

There's no way in TypeScript to make a template literal match a token **and** assign it to a type variable at the same time. If TypeScript supported the feature, it could look something like this:

```typescript
T extends `${infer C extends ClassName}${infer Tail}`
// `C` would refer to the actual token
```

But it doesn't.

I couldn't find a solution anywhere online, which lead me to [ask the question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65844206/how-to-avoid-ambiquity-in-typescript-template-literal-type-inference/65846728) in Stack Overflow. It took a while to marinate, but finally a solution clicked in my head.

To get access to the first token, you can inverse the inference with a second template literal inference:

```typescript
type GetTokenTrick<T extends string> =
  T extends `${ClassName}${infer Tail}`
    ? T extends `${infer C}${Tail}`
      ? C
      // This shouldn't be possible to reach, as
      // we just inversed the matching
      : never
    : never
```

Now the utility captures the first token!

```typescript
// type Debug = "block"
type Debug = GetTokenTrick<'block<whatever>'>
```

Let's combine the knowledge so far and also deal with the whitespace by using `Trim<Tail>`.

```typescript
type SplitToTailwindClassNames<T extends string> =
  // Does `T` start with a Tailwind class name?
  T extends `${ClassName}${infer Tail}`
    ? T extends `${infer C}${Tail}`
      // Continue consuming ClassName tokens with
      // next recursion iteration.
      ? [C, ...SplitToTailwindClassNames<Trim<Tail>>]

      // This shouldn't be possible to reach, as
      // we just inversed the matching
      : never

    // Stop recursion.
    : []
```

Many cases are now dealt correctly, but there's still a few issues.


```typescript
// type Debug1 = ["block"]
type Debug1 = SplitToTailwindClassNames<'block'>
// type Debug2 = ["block", "p-1"]
type Debug2 = SplitToTailwindClassNames<'block p-1'>
// type Debug3 = ["block", "p-1"]
type Debug3 = SplitToTailwindClassNames<'block\n\np-1   '>

// Still not working:

// Whitespace at the beginning
type Debug4 = SplitToTailwindClassNames<' block'>  // []

// Errors are not dealt correctly,
// should be [never]
type Debug5 = SplitToTailwindClassNames<'invalid'>  // []
```

The easiest way to fix the leading whitespace issue is to make a wrapper utility that calls `Trim`:

```typescript
type SplitToTailwindClassNames<T extends string> = SplitToTailwindClassNamesInner<Trim<T>>
```

The error handling can be improved by using the `Err` type and separating the "invalid T" and "end recursion" cases:


```typescript
type SplitToTailwindClassNamesInner<T extends string> =
  T extends `${ClassName}${infer Tail}`
    ? T extends `${infer C}${Tail}`
      ? [C, ...SplitToTailwindClassNames<Trim<Tail>>]
      : Err<'Should not happen'>

    // Added error handling
    // Handles cases where `T` does not match
    // ${ClassName}${Tail}. For example
    // 'block', '', '\n\n', 'invalid', or 'invalid  block'
    //
    // Note: `Tail` has already been trimmed from whitespace
    : T extends `${infer Tail}`
      ? Tail extends ClassName
        // `Tail` equals a valid Tailwind class.
        // End recursion succesfully.
        ? [Tail]
        : Trim<Tail> extends ''
          // `Tail` has only whitespace left.
          // End recursion succesfully.
          ? []
          // Something else was found.
          // Raise an error
          : [Err<`'${Tail}' is not a valid Tailwind class`>]

      // Should never happen as `T` is a string.
      : [Err<'Should not happen'>]
```

Finally we got to a version that handles all the cases as expected.


### 5. String type

Let's turn the pieces above into the final type utility which validates that a string contains only valid Tailwind classes. The utility only works if the string is a literal type such as `"p-1 block"`. A generic `string` type won't suffice, because template literals operate on string constants.

As the first step, let's validate that the input indeed is a literal string type.

```typescript
type IsValidTailwindClassString<T extends string> =
  string extends T
    ? Err<'Unexpected generic string'>
    // Make sure each item is a valid `ClassName`
    : SplitToTailwindClassNames<T> extends ClassName[]
      // If yes, success and return the type `T` itself
      ? T
      // If no, raise an error
      : Err<'Invalid Tailwind class string'>
```

Now when the utility is invoked with a generic `string`, we get an error:

```typescript
// INCORRECT
const str: string = 'generic string'

// type Debug = "Error: Unexpected generic string"
type Debug = IsValidTailwindClassString<typeof str>

// CORRECT
const str2 = 'p-1'

type Debug2 = IsValidTailwindClassString<typeof str2>
// type Debug2 = "p-1"
```

Also, we correctly get an error in case there's an invalid class name:

```typescript
// type Debug = "Error: Invalid Tailwind class string"
type Debug = IsValidTailwindClassString<`
  block
  bg-green-10c
`>
```

That's already awesome, but let's change it to show which tokens where invalid for a better developer experience. We could for example return the actual array that contains the correct Tailwind classes and errors.

```diff
     : SplitToTailwindClassNames<T> extends ClassName[]
       // If yes, success and return the type `T` itself
       ? T
       // If no, raise an error
-      : Err<'Invalid Tailwind class string'>
+      : SplitToTailwindClassNames<T>
```

It would work, but the error messages easily become too long to be useful. Another approach, which I like more, is to get the first error from the array. Fortunately we're dealing with just a flat array!

```typescript
// Gets the first string of an array that starts with 'Error: '
// Must be used only when `T` actually includes an error item
type GetFirstError<T extends unknown[]> =
  T extends [infer Head, ...infer Tail]
    ? Head extends `Error: ${infer Message}`
      // Match found, return
      ? Head
      // Continue searching for an error string
      : GetFirstError<Tail>
    : never
```

Let's add it to the string-validating utility and call it done.

```diff
     : SplitToTailwindClassNames<T> extends ClassName[]
       // If yes, success and return the type `T` itself
       ? T
       // If no, raise an error
-      : Err<'Invalid Tailwind class string'>
+      : GetFirstError<SplitToTailwindClassNames<T>>
```

Everything we've built so far has been now combined into a single utility type called `IsValidTailwindClassString`. That was a lot of work, but we still have a few other formats to cover.


### 6. Object type

The object format:

```js
{
  'block p-1': size === 'xl'
}
```

Proceed to tell about mapped types.



### 7. Array type




Array format:

```js
[
  'block p-1',
  {
    'block p-1': size === 'xl'
  }
]
```


Next, let's figure out the array format.

Proceed to tell about array recursion.


## Combining everything

With the individual pieces solved, it's time to put everything together.
