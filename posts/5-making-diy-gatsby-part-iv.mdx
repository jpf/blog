*This is the Part&nbsp;IV of a series where we'll look into how kimmo.blog works. Part&nbsp;IV focuses on the pros and cons.*

*Motivation has been covered in [Writing, or coding](../1-writing-or-coding/).*

## Pros

* Network tab to see bundle sizes
* Good learning
* Rollup
* Page sizes are small considering what we can achieve with the stack


## Cons

* Even though it is technically simpler than Gatsby, it's not easier to onboard anyone else to the project.
* Complicated, I made my own framework with bad documentation and no tests
* Slow dev iteration
* Rollup config had some pitfalls
