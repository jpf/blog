Publishing a blog has been on my bucket list for many years.

All previous attempts have failed at an early stage: choosing the tech stack. There's a lot of existing solutions out there: Medium, dev.to, WordPress, Blogger, Jekyll, plain Github Gists, and many more. *Why not just pick one and start writing?*

For a couple of years, the question has been popping into my head every once in a while. I've tried [Medium](https://medium.com/@kimmobrunfeldt/introduction-to-sauce-labs-3ad082fc7dd5) for a few testing related posts, [Blogger](http://scouringmacbook.blogspot.com/2012/10/setting-everything.html) for macOS configuration posts, [WordPress](https://alvarcarto.com/) for a business website, [Github repo](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/howto-everything) with `.md` files, and many open-source solutions like Jekyll, Ghost, Hugo, and Hexo. They all worked and most can be customised completely, but somehow they didn't *feel* like the _"ultimate solution"_.

The content I want to share is tightly related code and my vision is to make the posts interactive, visual, and understandable. That already requires a lot from the platform. I'm thinking:

> If I start a blog, the platform shouldn't come in the way of expressing ideas.

In addition to the subjective arguments and feelings, I've gathered a list of other goals and requirements:

* custom domain
* permanent URLs for posts
* technically flexible for possible needs in the future: *code highlighting*, *SVG animations*, *interactive charts*, and *any custom components* that help understanding concepts
* content should be readable without JavaScript
* no paywalls or login walls
* no _"kimmo.blog wants to know your location"_
* no _"kimmo.blog wants to send you notifications"_ right after closing the location request
* no distractions from the real content

Self-hosted open source blog platforms looked very tempting, but in the end I chose to start one from scratch and grow the tech solution organically. It felt more interesting.

So DIY it is. I'm familiar with React ecosystem and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) has worked before.

    Alright, I kinda get the points. Will you be using Gatsby or React Static then?
  </ChatMessage>
  <ChatMessage from="me">
    Well...
  </ChatMessage>
</ChatDiscussion>

After a bit of initial hesitation between do-it-yourself or `npm install`, I decided to `git init` and started coding a DIY Gatsby-like static site generator. That's right, I ignored all rational arguments and started wasting my time on irrelevant details.

But actually I don't think it's a waste of time at all.

First, it's intruiging and fun. It's very refreshing to jump out of the business boundaries for a while. Your casual projects don't need to be cost-efficient or lean, you can just wing it and have fun! _(or skip free time coding, that's totally fine too)_

Reinventing the wheel is a great learning opportunity, but it less often makes sense when solving end users' problems. I've used [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) in a few work projects but haven't _really_ dug into the internals. Occasionally I find myself wondering:

> Why's Gatsby's output directory so huge?
>
> Why's there so many requests on page load?

Now I know. Server-side rendered *(SSR)* React sites are complex, there's no way around it. _"Server-side rendered"_ and _"static site generation"_ are practically the same in this context: both render React components as HTML for the initial page load, which is later *[React.hydrate()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate)d* in the browser.

I'm using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for the blog post content. It allows writing familiar Markdown and injecting React components in the content. The components are useful for adding [visual](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/) cues that support the textual content.

The benefits may or may not be worth the added complexity of SSR. I'll let you decide. Even though I learned a lot, the developer experience with my static site generator is pretty archaic. I'm not sure if this was the best decision, but I'm happy with the result. More about the solution on another post.

I don't know if this will lead to the _"ultimate solution"_. The blog could become a yet another React-bloated site â€” or something cool.
